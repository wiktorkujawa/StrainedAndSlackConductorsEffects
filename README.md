# EffectsOfShortAndCircuitCurrentOnStrainedAndSlackConductors
Program allow to calculate effects of short-circuit currents on slack and strained conductors.
## Used technologies and interface presentation
Application was written in C(calculations) + Octave(plots).Program is just a beta version focused on calculation part. Future version will contain advanced GUI instead of console.
